Countdown Timer React Hook
This custom React Hook, useCountdownTimer, provides a simple and reusable solution for implementing countdown timers in React applications.

It uses the setInterval function to update the timer every second, ensuring real-time accuracy.

Features:
Flexible Deadline: Accepts a deadline as a string and dynamically calculates the remaining time.
Real-Time Updates: Utilizes the setInterval function to keep the countdown timer up-to-date every second.
Formatted Output: Returns the remaining time in a formatted object with years, days, hours, minutes, and seconds.
